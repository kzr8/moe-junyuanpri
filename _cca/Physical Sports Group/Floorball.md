Floorball is a fast-paced indoor team sports game that is fun and exciting. The rules are simple and is safe for students.  
  
Our Junyuan floorball team is made up of passionate players, teachers and coaches. We aim to develop in our students the values of respect, resilience, responsibility, sportsmanship and care in our weekly sessions. We give opportunities to students to take part in national competitions and those with good leadership qualities to lead their peers.
