The Volleyball CCA aims to educate its members on the schoolsâ€™ 7 character values through the teachable moments that are presented to them when they play volleyball. We also try to foster a strong bond between all the members by empowering them. We strive to ensure our members are able to play and appreciate the game of volleyball.
