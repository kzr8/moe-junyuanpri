### **Co-Curricular Activities Group**  

##### &nbsp;**1.&nbsp;Objectives of Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) Group in JYPS**  

The JYPS CCA Programme provides students with a platform to discover their interests and talents and develop themselves holistically across all domains.&nbsp;

  

Our Physical Sports CCA groups develop resilience, fair play and team spirit in students through developing their sports-specific skills so that they can appreciate and enjoy playing the game. They will also have the opportunity to train and condition themselves towards competitive play in the annual National School Games.&nbsp;

  

Our Visual and Performing Arts groups instill in our students a sense of graciousness and an appreciation for the rich culture and heritage of our multi-racial &amp; multi-cultural society.&nbsp;

  

Our Uniformed Groups instill citizenship in our students by inculcating in them self-reliance, resilience, discipline and a spirit of service to others.&nbsp;

  

Our Clubs and Societies allow our students to explore and extend their interests in information, communication and subject-specific skills as they strive to grow their mastery in these specialised areas.&nbsp;

  

Our CCAs offer excellent platforms for students to acquire core values, social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st Century Competencies. Through active participation in these CCAs, our students develop a sense of identity and belonging to Junyuan Primary School.
