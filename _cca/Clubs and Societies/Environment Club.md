# Environment Club

![](/images/Environment%20Club_Pic%201.jpeg)

The Environment Club aims to (i) cultivate environmental awareness in pupils and inculcate in them a sense of responsibility and respect for the environment, (ii) develop their understanding of environmental issues, conservation and sustainable living, and (iii) empower pupils to raise and promote environmental awareness amongst their peers and in the community, while (iv) instilling character values in them.  
  
Pupils learn to be self-directed learners and make their own decisions as they research on different environmental issues and work on various projects such as creating their own games through upcycling waste materials, and creating posters and songs to spread environmental messages. Through these group projects, pupils learn to interact and work well with others. They also build resilience and learn about sustainable living through their weekly gardening sessions where they work hard under the sun to take care of the edible vegetation in Vegetopia (JYPS’ very own vegetable garden), ensuring that the plants grow well. Harvesting sessions always bring wide smiles to the pupils’ faces when they see the fruits of their labour as they learn the value of hard work.
