Library Club
============

![](/images/LIBRARY%20&amp;%20DRAMA%20CLUB_0263%20FORMAL.jpeg)

In Junyuan Library Club, we hope to develop&nbsp;the love of reading in our student librarians through the various book-related activities organised for them. Our student librarians do more than just cataloguing and shelving books. They also recommend book titles and put up thematic displays in the library. To develop our student librarians to be confident communicators (one of Junyuanâ€™s Desired Outcomes), they get to showcase their talents through storytelling. They are given the opportunity to develop their leadership potential through facilitating book-related activities for the school especially during Language Week.
