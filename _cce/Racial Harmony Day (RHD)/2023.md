## Racial Harmony Day (RHD) 2023

Our school commemorates this year’s Racial Harmony Day (RHD) over two days with a special skit and &nbsp;fringe activities facilitated by P4 Form Teachers, parent volunteers from the Parent Support Group and&nbsp;  CCE Ambassadors. On 20 and 21 July, students from different cultures interacted with one another through play, in song and at crafts.

The commemoration started out with a skit “Not everything is just song and dance!” performed by our talents from our CCA Drama Club during Mass Assembly. The skit told a story about how two different groups of students in a school decided to put aside their differences and come together to give a rousing concert to celebrate Teachers’ Day. Our students were enthralled by the student actors’ performance to entrench the importance of shared values of diversity and inclusivity. It was also very heartwarming to see a P5 class prepared a banner and cheered loudly for one of their classmates who performed this skit on stage. It showed the strength of their friendship within the class.

During recess, students strengthened their relationships with their peers through “Let’s Play Play Together” in the Basketball Court featuring &nbsp;traditional games such as&nbsp;gasing, hopscotch and&nbsp;_chapteh;_ as well as traditional table games such as _kuti kuti_ and five stones in the canteen. At the Puzzle-making Booth in the canteen, students worked in pairs to piece together a puzzle “Let’s Make Make Together” centered on the RHD theme “Our Multicultural Mosaic”. Many students clamoured to &nbsp;participate in online quiz “Who wants to be a Singaporeaire?” at JY Village to tease out their knowledge of the different traditional food that originated from the different ethnic groups living in Singapore. Students also queued up to get their hands hennaed to the shapes of flowers, geometric shapes and even the occasional Spiderman. And for the first time in Junyuan Primary School, a KTV booth “Let’s Sing Sing Together” was set up. Students linked arms and crowded around the booth to wabble heartily the different Singapore songs with their friends. Echos of “Chan Mali Chan”, “Munnaeru Vaalibaa”, “Xi Shui Chang Liu” and of course the evergreen “Home”, reverberated throughout the walls of the school.

Indeed, students’ multicultural bond deepened as they paired up or teamed up with their schoolmates from different ethnic groups to participate in these RHD fringe activities.
