## Racial Harmony Day (RHD) 2019


The theme for this year’s Racial Harmony Day (RHD) is&nbsp;_The Singapore Connection_. On 18, 19 and 22 July, JYPS offered opportunities during recess for students to be connected as Singaporeans through play. Game booths were set up in Junyuan Village as fringe activities to commemorate this year’s Racial Harmony Day. For those three days, students strengthened their peer relationships through a wide range of traditional games such as&nbsp;_kuti kuti_, paper balls, hopscotch,&nbsp;_chapteh_, pick-up sticks, tops and&nbsp;_congkak_. Students also learnt how to play Cat’s Cradle, otherwise known as the Patterned String Game, a rather challenging game which involves looping a string between fingers to create patterns. At the Heritage Photo Booth, students were given opportunities to try on different ethnic attires and strike poses, preserving precious memories.&nbsp;

To entrench the shared values of diversity and inclusivity, our students watched a skit, “Raju And the Mixed-Up Washing” during mass assembly, as well as treated to a repertoire of heritage songs performed by talented musicians from our Pioneer and&nbsp;_Merdeka_&nbsp;generations.&nbsp;

On the last day of the fringe activities, students from Suzhou, who were in our school for a school immersion, also participated in the traditional games. While immersed in playing the games such as&nbsp;_congkak_&nbsp;with their P5 buddies, they marvelled at how JYPS students from different ethnic groups played happily with one another at the various games booths. Indeed, we are glad we are able to share with them our Singapore Spirit and the JYPS’s spirit of “We are One”.
