Total Defence Day 2023&nbsp;
-----------------------

Our school commemorated this year’s Total Defence on 9 February with&nbsp;Current Affair with Values Embedded (CAVE) lesson on food security where students learnt the importance of remaining resilience and resourceful during disruptions, followed by TDD fringe activities during recess on 15 and 16 February and a mass assembly programme on 16 February. Throughout the commemoration,&nbsp;the importance of playing one’s part to “Keep Singapore Strong” and ways to keep our nation strong through the 6 Pillars of Total Defence were reinforced and enacted through the activities.  

  

Awareness and appreciation of different military and civil defence roles that keep our nation safe and secure were bolstered. Our younger lower primary students got to dress up as different frontliners for the Avatars of the Sg World station while at the Guardians of Sg World station, the students listened attentively to the teachers who explained to them in details how our Singapore soldiers, airmen and sailors ensure the security and peace we enjoy in Singapore. At the Slam The Scam station, our students learnt how&nbsp;to strengthen digital defence by playing the Scambuster card game. They also learnt how to spend and use wisely at the Economic Defence Station. Using play money, the Lower Primary learnt how to spend wisely while the Upper Primary took part in in-house created virtual game to fortify the concept of waste not so as to conserve our resources and the environment. At the “United We Stand” station, students worked in groups to put together their very own “United We Stand” art piece, reminding one another that we need to be united as one people to keep Singapore strong.&nbsp;During mass assembly, police officers from Tampines NPC reinforced in our students the protocol of “Run Hide Tell” in the Sg Secure Talk. Several students who participated actively during the talk were given limited edition Scambuster Card set and SPF police toy cars.

  

We are blessed to have strong support from the Parent Support Group. Many parents came over to support and facilitate the fringe activities during recess. They, together with our staff, put together exemplified the spirit of Total Defence which is to involve every Singaporean playing a part, individually and collectively, to build a strong, secure and cohesive nation. When we are strong, we are able to deal with any crisis.
