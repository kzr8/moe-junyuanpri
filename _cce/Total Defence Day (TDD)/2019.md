### Total Defence Day(TDD) 2019
----------------------------

Total Defence Day falls on 15 February each year to commemorate the fall of Singapore during WW2. The theme for this year is “Together We Keep Singapore Strong”. The teachers and students were able to resonate with this year’s TDD message through exposure to the Five Pillars of TDD during the fringe activities held during recess from 13 February 2019 to 15 February 2019, CCE lessons and mass assembly shows. Through the two different assembly shows, students were taught how to defend themselves against cyberattacks on common social media platforms and how to identify fake news.  

  

As part of the fringe activities, the Singapore Police Force were invited to our school to interact with our students on 14 February 2019. Students got to examine the interior of a police car and try on bullet-proof vests provided by the Home Team. During the fringe activities, students were also given the opportunity to strengthen their commitment to Total Defence by participating in the TDD pledge-taking and a quiz about TDD. They also learnt some basic first-aid and played different TDD roles in the Defence Heroes Photo Booth. Lower Primary pupils were engaged through “The True Story of the Three Little Pigs”, a twisted tale of how the wolf was maligned due to fake news, by our very own, and very talented storyteller, Ms Nisha.

  

For the very first time in Junyuan’s history, the TDD message was shared via a broadcast from Studio 91 on 15 February 2019 by our Principal, Miss Chiam. The message, from Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen, stressed that cyber-security threats and disinformation are a serious danger to Singapore, and emphasised the need to be vigilant against them. To cap the commemoration, the school was engaged in an evacuation drill to emphasis the need to be always prepared for an emergency.
