P1-P4 Buddy Programme
============


The first few days of school can be an exciting yet daunting experience for many Primary 1 students. To help ease them into the school environment, JYPS has a buddy system which pairs every Primary 1 student with a Primary 5 student. This system has helped the new students gradually adapt to the rigours of our school. The Primary 1 students also learnt how to take care of themselves in school during the Buddy Programme. After a hiatus of two years because of COVID Safety Management Measures, our P4 students will be buddying the incoming P1 students in 2023.
