**Values in Action (VIA)** is a Key Student Development Experience (SDE) that aims to nurture socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. VIA is designed to engender student ownership and initiative. As part of VIA, students reflect on their experience, the values they have put into practice, and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully.<br>
VIA is an important component of National Education and the holistic development of students for the following reasons:&nbsp;<br>
1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  VIA promotes active citizenry by involving students in meaningful community         service to school and community.<br>
2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;VIA provides an opportunity for moral action and recognition of moral action.

Our school provides various learning platforms and opportunities for students to be equipped with the knowledge, moral and civic values, skills and dispositions to become **_Responsible and Caring Citizens._** These activities are based on experiential learning pedagogy, including dialogue, discussion and reflection, and intentional application of values, social-emotional, and civic competencies.

For a start, all students will show commitment to keep our school clean and green through “Everyday Responsibility” and the recycling programme. As they move up the level, students will get to experience different VIA activities. For example, in Primary 1, they will plan and carry out caring actions which have an impact on others, allowing them to express their love, care and support for their family and friends. In Primary 4, they will participate in the P1-4 Buddy Programme to befriend Primary 1 students during the first week of the new school year. This is to increase their understanding in what it means to be part of a school community, and about the ways they can make the school community a better place to live, work and play in. In Primary 6, our students will do research on the needs of the elderly and how to engage them (in collaboration with i.Innovate Committee for Design Thinking). They learn to plan activities and games to engage with the elderly and reach out to them.

Selected students such as student leaders will also get to contribute actively and positively by befriending the Kindergarten 2 Students. They will get to engage the K2 students to introduce JYPS and primary school life in various activities.

Through the VIA Programme, we hope to inculcate awareness of, advocacy and action for the needs of the people around them.
