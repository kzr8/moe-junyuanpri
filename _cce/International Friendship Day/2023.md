### International Friendship Day 2023&nbsp;
----------------------------------

Our school commemorated International Friendship Day (IFD) with a series of activities based on the theme of “Singapore In Asia” this year. Through these activities, our students were not only led to appreciate the importance of building and strengthening friendships among our neighbouring countries, especially the ASEAN countries, but also deepen the connection with them, as well as nurture the spirit of friendship and collaboration among different peoples.

Fringe activities to foster understanding and appreciation of the cultures of our ASEAN neighbours were organised during recess on 5 and 6 April. Facilitated by members from the Parents’ Support Group (PSG), the students participated in popular games played in ASEAN countries. One such game is tumbang preso, a popular game played by children in the Philippines. The game involved the throwing of slipper at a bottle. Through their participation in this game, the students learnt that how innovative children are to make use of daily items such as slippers to play a game.  

Students also participated in the differentiated Art activities whereby the students either made a Waku Kite Bookmark or paper dolls donned in Thai, Malaysian, Indonesian or Filipino traditional costumes. The participants were piqued by the uniqueness of each of these traditional designs. At the quiz station and ASEAN MATCH station, students demonstrated their understanding of the cultures and features of the ASEAN countries. During the fringe activities, all the CCE Ambassadors and Monitors entrenched their friendship with their peers by guiding them in playing these activities. 

Last but not least, the students enjoyed a mass assembly concert , watching the  energetic performance from Modern Dance CCA and MIC groups. The students joined in enthusiastically to sing with the MIC performers the song “ It’s a Small World”. This concert reminded all of us that despite our diversity, we can work together as a community in achieving the ASEAN’s spirit of friendship and collaboration.
