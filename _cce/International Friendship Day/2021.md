### International Friendship Day 2021 
----------------------------------

International Friendship Day (IFD) is commemorated annually to remind our students the importance of building and strengthening friendships among our neighbouring countries (especially the ASEAN countries), deepening the connection with them, as well as nurturing the spirit of friendship and collaboration among different people.

Our school commemorated International Friendship Day (IFD) on 8 April based on the theme “Singapore in the World”, albeit taking the constraints of the Safe Management Measures of Covid-19 in our stride.

  

On that day, the whole school enjoyed watching virtual performances by our school’s Modern Dance CCA and MIC Group. Our talents artists, through their performances, showed how vibrant our ASEAN and International communities are.

After watching the lively digitalised concert, the students were engaged in meaningful class’s discussion on how Singaporeans have shown kindness towards migrant workers in the midst of coping with the COVID pandemic as a nation. This was to raise awareness the contributions made by our foreign friends living and working in Singapore.

To foster understanding and appreciation of the cultures of our ASEAN neighbours, the students participated in the fringe activities via the Student Learning Space (SLS). The students learnt about the different cultures, traditions and the way of life of the people in the other ASEAN countries. The Upper Primary did paper weaving, a traditional ASEAN craft, while the Lower Primary did the ASEAN Cloud, featuring the 10 ASEAN members on the Cloud.
