### International Friendship Day 2019
---------------------------------


Our school commemorated International Friendship Day (IFD) with a series of activities based on the theme of “Connected Communities” this year. Through these activities, our students were not only led to appreciate the importance of building and strengthening friendships among our neighbouring countries, especially the ASEAN countries, but also deepen the connection with them, as well as nurture the spirit of friendship and collaboration among different peoples.  
  
Fringe activities to foster understanding and appreciation of the cultures of our ASEAN neighbours were organised during recess in the second week of Term 2. Facilitated by parent volunteers from the Parents’ Support Group (PSG), the students participated in traditional games commonly played in other ASEAN countries such as “Semut, Orang, Gajah”, a version of “Scissors, Paper and Stone” played in Indonesia. They also experienced playing “Bamboo Jack”, a traditional game played in Vietnam and Cambodia. During the fringe activities, Primary 5 students entrenched their friendship with their Primary 1 buddies by participating in the activities together. To deepen our connections within the community, we also invited 46 kindergarteners to participate in the fringe activities on IFD as part of the K21 School Experience programme.  Our student leaders played buddy to the kindergarteners while participating in the fringe activities and class experience. If you were present at Junyuan Village on 8 April 2019, you would have observed them encouraging their charges to gyrate to the music of Thai Cha-Cha line dance and taking candid shots among the eight standees depicting the ethic costumes of the ASEAN countries.  
  
Last but not least, the students enjoyed a mass assembly concert which started off with a skit based on the book “Crow Boy” written by Taro Yashima which promotes the value of inclusivity among diversity. It spoke about the importance of respecting and accepting the differences amongst us. This value is reinforced through the fringe activity of Inclusivity Booth which promotes the awareness that each student is unique and has different needs and abilities. The concert ended with the singing of folk songs from ASEAN and an energetic performance from International Dance CCA group.
