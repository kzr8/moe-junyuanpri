##### **Roving Reporters**  
Pupils are given the opportunities to take on the role as reporters. They write their own scripts and report on school events. They also get to interview teachers, parents and pupils to find out how they feel about the event. To be able to think on your feet, remain poise and confidence when the camera rolls could be nerve wracking but our pupils rise to the occasion.  
  
The following are some roving reporters in action during the P5 Overseas Learning Trip and Racial Harmony Celebration.

### READING PROGRAMMES

  

##### **Ask Me To Read (AMTR)**

To develop and maintain a vibrant school library and reading culture, our department rides on this AMTR programme where teachers promote books of different categories during pre-morning assemblies once a month. Teachers will encourage pupils to borrow books of a particular category shared.

##### **Reading Journey (P1)**

This is a programme to encourage our P1 pupils to read widely. Pupils read to our Parent Volunteers, complete a short and simple review based on the books that they have read and share them with the Parent Volunteers. These reading sessions have proven effective in promoting reading amongst our young ones. Reading sessions are conducted weekly during LIP periods in the library.  

##### **STARLETS Programme(P1)**

This year, the English department embarked on the STARLETS programme for the Primary 1 pupils. This programme aimed to enhance pupils’ reading abilities by targeting the foundational reading skills, phonological awareness and alphabetic principle. Pupils were taught these skills through engaging and meaningful reading activities. Pupils were also taught how to apply these skills when they read. This programme has helped build pupils confidence in reading and speaking, in turn making them effective and confident communicators.

  

##### **Enhanced Library Instruction Programme (P2 - P6)**

The programme is carefully designed to expose pupils to varied genres as well as to make reading meaningful through engaging pupils in different reading-related activities when they visit the school library. &nbsp;

  

At P2 and P3, we expose pupils to different genres such as fiction, fairy tales, humour, non-fiction / endangered animals and amazing facts. While from P4 - P6, pupils are engaged in book hunt sessions where they hunt for non-fiction books in the school library and non-fiction texts online. They will then write or draw a book summary, create word splash, fact sheets on a particular topic they choose to work on. These activities aim to heighten pupils’ awareness and development of visual, discipline and media literacy in non-fiction texts.

  

##### **Book Flood (P1 – P6)**

A set of books is available in P1 – P3 classroom to encourage every pupil to read widely and frequently.&nbsp; The pupils also take the books home to read to their parents. This allows for bonding between the child and parents through such a meaningful activity.

P4 – P6 pupils also borrow books from the school library for their silent reading daily.


MOE Reading Support Programmes (P1 - P4)

Pupils who require further support in reading are enrolled into the following programmes according to their needs.

*   Learning Support Programme (LSP) a.k.a. Rainbow Classes (P1 &amp; P2)
*   Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) (P3 &amp; P4)
*   School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR) Programme (P3 &amp; P4)


##### **Partnership with NLB for Whole School Reading Programme**

We have been collaborating with the National Library Board in promoting reading in our school. Apart from Books2Go and Assembly Talks like Storytelling and Book Buzz. Some pupils also took part in the Kids’ Lit Quiz co-organised with POSB and Read for Books which is a charity book drive.

### **EVENTS**

##### **Library Festival**

During Library Festival, pupils can look forward to playing games that are tied to a theme during recess at the library. Games were also conducted in their Mother Tongue languages. We hope to spark pupils' curiosity about the wonderful world of books through these exciting activities.

  

In year 2019, the theme was on “STEAM”. Students had a chance to engage in literacy activities such as: Books Come to Life, Puppet Storytelling, Feed the Sharks and The 3E.
