The school currently has 3 air-conditioned computer laboratories. Each laboratory is equipped with 40 Intel Core i5-based computers. Our pupils are now able to spend more of their curriculum time using Information and Communication Technology with the completion of our new Project Work Room equipped with the IRT tables to facilitate Collaborative Learning. The room provides pupils with the necessary resources to complete their multimedia projects and for teachers to conduct ICT-based lessons. To enable our pupils to have easy access to computers, free access areas have been set up. The Junyuan Express aims to promote independent learning among our pupils and give them the opportunity to broaden their learning as they conduct research on their own. We are also pleased to announce that we have set up our very own Studio 91 and our pupils have had the opportunity to speak on the air and interviewed 2 Ministers who visited JYPS.

One of MOE’s key priorities for all pupils in recent years is to set Baseline ICT(Information & Communication Technology) Standards so as to ensure that all pupils acquire the necessary ICT skills to support them in learning and prepare them for future needs. At the end of the Primary and Secondary Education, pupils will have acquired a basic set of ICT skills:

  

Primary school pupils will be able to:

  

*   Operate computers and applications in ICT-enabled learning environment
*   Search for information and communicate over the Internet
*   Create a short document using a word processor
*   Represent tables of information in word processors and spreadsheets
*   Create a short presentation with multimedia elements
*   Collect data using ICT tools

  

The ICT department has planned ICT training programmes that are in line with the Baseline ICT Standards and that are progressive in nature. At the end of the Primary and Secondary education, pupils will also have acquired skills related to ethical and legal as well as safe and responsible use of ICT.

  

Among others, primary school pupils will:

  

*   Use appropriate language, demonstrate mutual respect and observe etiquette in communication
*   Respond appropriately when encountering illegal or unsuitable materials on the Internet.
*   Be aware of and take precautionary steps against the dangers of cyber abuse.
*   Respect intellectual property and comply with copyright laws and regulations.
*   Maintain a balanced use of technology to avoid computer addiction
*   Verify the credibility of information and that information is communicated accurately and responsibly

  

To realize the full potential of ICT for teaching and learning, it is important that pupils practise ethical and legal as well as safe and responsible use of ICT. In order to facilitate your child’s learning in an ICT-enabled environment, the school has come up with Acceptable Use Policies. Every child has signed this AUP in January/February which is in their Student's Handbook.
