Physical Education
==================

#### ‘Experience, Enjoy, Excel’

In Junyuan Primary School, the Physical Education (PE) curriculum and programmes aim to give every pupil an enriching EXPERIENCE during PE lessons so that they can ENJOY a lifetime of healthy and active lifestyle. Through the acquisition of these foundational physical skills and abilities, we also encourage and provide platforms for pupils to develop their talents so that they can EXCEL in sports.

#### The 7 learning areas in Physical Education are:

Athletics (From Primary 3)

Dance

Games and Sports

Gymnastics 

Outdoor Education 

Physical Health and Fitness 

Swimming (Primary 3)


The Primary 1 & Primary 2 lessons focus on the exploration and mastery of fundamental motor skills such as locomotor, non-locomotor and manipulative skills with application of movement concepts to develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in students’ performance. 

Primary 3 & Primary 4 lessons extend onto the mastery of discrete skills to focus on more complex combinations and sequences of movements, and skills application in more recognizable forms of activity and games.

The Primary 5 and 6 lessons focus on the development of games-related concepts through modified games. Both fundamental and specialised skills and movement concepts are required in playing these games. Games can be categorised into the following categories:

  

  

*   Net-barrier
*   Striking-fielding
*   Territorial-invasion
