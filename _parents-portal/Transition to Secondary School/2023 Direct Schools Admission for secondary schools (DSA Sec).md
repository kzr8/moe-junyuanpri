2023 Direct Schools Admission for secondary schools (DSA-Sec)
=============================================================


Introduced in 2004, the DSA scheme provides students with the opportunity to seek admission to a secondary school, based on a diverse range of specific academic and non-academic achievements and talents that they can demonstrate beyond the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). P6 students who do not participate in the DSA-Sec will continue to seek admission based on their PSLE score through the Secondary 1 (S1) Posting.

  

We wish to highlight that DSA is a commitment on the part of both the student and the secondary school. Students successfully allocated to their DSA-Sec schools will NOT be allowed to participate in the annual S1 Posting to opt for secondary schools, and are expected to honour the commitment to the allocated DSA-Sec school for the entire duration of the programme to develop their talents. They will also NOT be allowed to transfer to another school after the release of the PSLE results.
