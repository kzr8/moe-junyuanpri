#### 1. Road Safety of Students 

##### 1.1 Please refer to the letter dated 1 March 2021 on ‘Road Safety of Students’ [(ANNEX A)](/files/annex%20a%20_letter%20to%20parents_road%20safety.pdf)

##### 1.2 Policies for vehicles coming into and exiting schools during dry days and rainy days.
Vehicular movement within the school is restricted during assembly and dismissal periods. The school’s car park lots are strictly for season parking holders only. <u>Parents are not allowed to park their vehicles in the school’s parking lots.</u> Visitors such as MOE personnel on official business are allowed to park in the designated parking lots for visitors. Security guards are deployed as traffic marshals to direct cars coming into schools to drop off students in the morning before school. <br>
Motorists are to adhere to the 15 km/hr speed limit in the school premises. All motorists are reminded to slow down when entering or leaving school  The School Zone  requires motorists to drive at a reduced speed limit of 40km/h helps to create a safer road environment for all road users.   

The following measures are implemented to restrict vehicular movements: <br>
a)	<b>Dry days</b> <br>
Designated pick up/drop off (PUDO) points of students are established.  Parents are only allowed to drive into the school before 7.30am to drop-off their children at the PUDO point at the Bus Bay. They are not allowed to drive into the school to pick up students after school dismissal except for reasons such as when the student is unwell or with medical conditions. Parents are required to display a “Drop Off” car label for easy identification by the Security Guards. Parents may apply for the “Drop Off” car label online (https://go.gov.sg/jyps-vehicle-access). They are to display the “Drop-Off” Car Label prominently and drive slowly if they are entering the school compound to drop off their children. <br>

For the safety of our students, vehicles are not allowed to leave / enter the 
school ground 10 minutes before school dismissal. <u>Only authorised vehicles by the school are allowed to enter the school after school dismissal.</u>  The school will not be permitting vehicular entry for Student Care Centre (SCC) dismissal from 6 Feb 2023 (Monday) onwards.  This is in view of the vehicular movement within the school premises during dismissal which poses a safety concern for students especially when they walk towards the waiting area to be fetched by parents.

For pick-up arrangements, parents / guardians are advised to park their vehicles at the nearby HDB carpark at Blk 915 Tampines Street 91 and wait for their children outside Side Gate 1.

b) <b>Rainy days</b><br>
The policy during dry days applies for rainy days as well.

•	Students walking to the school from SPC petrol station are advised NOT to cross at the junction of Tampines St 91 and Tampines Ave 4 (in-front of SPC petrol station).  They should walk along the footpath and use the signalised pedestrian crossing at Block 915 Tampines Street 91 to enter the school through Side Gate 1 as shown in <b>['ANNEX C'](/files/annex%20c_%20safe%20_routes%20__parents%20portal_2023.pdf).</b>
