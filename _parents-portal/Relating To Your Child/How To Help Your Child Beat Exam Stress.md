How To Help Your Child Beat Exam Stress
=======================================

Exam time can be very stressful for everyone in the family. While some pressure may be healthy and positive, too much of it can be detrimental to your child’s health, leaving the parent anxious and stressed as well.   

  

Psychologists have observed that often, academic-related anxieties and its ensuing effect on a child's life stem from parents who, consciously or not, offload it on their child. Here are some tips on how you can help your child cope with exam pressure.

**1\. Know your child’s studying style.** Some children are independent and self-directed. Adjust your level of supervision and monitoring accordingly.

  

**2\. Talk to them.** Avoid nagging or criticizing. You’re their best cheerleader! Research has shown that parental involvement – checking their homework, discussing about school - has the biggest impact on student’s academic performance more than anything else.

  

**3\. Lights out!** Ensure that he/she gets at least 7-8 hours of sleep daily.

  

**4\. Eat right!** Don’t allow them to skip meals, especially breakfast. Regular and nutritious meals help to keep their minds alert and boost their concentration levels.

  

**5\. Balance work and play.** Set aside time for play and recreation (e.g. going for a walk, painting, listening to music) so that he/she looks forward to these activities and learns to unwind and de-stress.

  

**6\. Teach them relaxation skills**. Deep belly-breathing, calming mental images and tensing and loosening of their tight muscles are great ways to keep stress at bay. Exercise is also a great stress-buster!
