Praise Your Child Today!
========================

<img src="/images/Praise.png" style="width:290px;height:240px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right">

Research shows that parent-child connectedness is one of the more effective ways of prevention against risky behavior in children.  

  

Affirming their strengths and positive qualities builds a safe environment at home for children to confide in you. It will also build resilience and nurture them for success.

In support of the _Race to Praise_ Campaign, we would like to invite you to be involved in praising your child daily! Race to Praise Campaign: [https://campaigns.family.org.sg/race-to-praise](https://campaigns.family.org.sg/race-to-praise).

  

You can also visit their website [www.family.org.sg](http://www.family.org.sg/) for more parenting resources and programmes. Thank you!
