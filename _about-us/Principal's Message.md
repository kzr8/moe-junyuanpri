Principal's Message
===================



<img src="/images/Principal.jpeg" style="width:35%">


<i>Hello and welcome to Junyuan Primary School!</i>

<i>We invite you to imagine with us students been assigned with the task to design a solution that will help extend the lifespan of the Pulau Semakau Landfill. From suggestions that seem to aim for the moon to prototypes that appear amateurish, the children pitch their solutions with a mix of innocence and confidence in their small “work” groups. Or visualise with us pre-schoolers encountering a pea flower for the first time. Captivated, they bombard their teacher with strings of questions that adults would not ask and leave the teacher speechless but smiling.</i>

<i>These children have a sense of wonder about the things happening around them. They seem to carry with them a curiosity about the world and an enthusiasm to try things new.  They are not fictional. They can be found in our school. More encouragingly, restrictions imposed on them during the pandemic have not extinguished their spirit to learn and the willingness to care for the world around them.</i>

<i>We see them discover pleasure in learning when the things they do and try coinciding with the interests that they harbour, when time and space is given for them to tinker with ideas that they generate – alone or as a group, when their efforts and creations are recognised, and when they are given the chance to explore beyond the limits of the classrooms to the world beyond.</i>

<i>As we commemorate 35 years of our school’s founding, we want to celebrate the joy that accompanies our children’s learning as they grow and glow in their journey with us. We invite you to join us on this ride!</i>

  

Wishing you a joyful and fruitful year of learning in 2023!
