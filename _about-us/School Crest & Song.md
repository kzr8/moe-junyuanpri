School Crest & Song
===================

![](/images/Logo.png)

### School Crest

The circular shape symbolises unity.

The three big Js pointing toward the centre show our common purpose in achieving our school motto, Work To Excel.

The three small Js represent the three areas for our pupils to excel in body, mind and spirit.

The floral design formed by all Js symbolises the blossoming spirit of achievement.

  

  

### School Song

We who are in Junyuan

Take every task to heart

To reach the goal of excellence

We'll keep a will to make progress

We'll work to excel

We'll work to excel

And learning together joyfully, joyfully learning

We shall bring glory to Junyuan

With harmony and loyalty
